# 🔱 Satan Programming Language

Satan is a modern programming language designed specifically for blazing-fast Data Science and Machine Learning.  
Crafted in C++ for performance, yet offering the elegance and clarity of Python, Satan empowers you to build intelligent systems at scale.

---

## 🚀 Why Satan?

- ⚡️ Built on C++20 for maximum speed and zero-overhead abstractions.
- 🧠 Designed for ML/AI from the ground up: training loops, tensor math, and GPU support.
- 🪶 Pythonic syntax: easy to write, read, and debug.
- 🔬 Statistical programming built-in: like R, but faster.
- 🧵 Parallel, GPU, and async support baked into the language.

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

Satan is built with these core principles:

- 🧩 Modularity over complexity
- ⚔️ Performance without sacrificing clarity
- 🎯 AI-first: everything ML-ready out of the box
- 🧬 Extensibility via modules (like python packages, but compiled and optimized)

---

## 🧪 Example Code

```bash
let data = read_csv("iris.csv")

let model = Sequential(
Dense(64, activation="relu"),
Dense(3, activation="softmax")
)

model.train(data.X, data.y, epochs=100)

if model.accuracy > 0.9 {
print("Model trained successfully! 🚀")
}
```

Looks like Python. Performs like C++.
